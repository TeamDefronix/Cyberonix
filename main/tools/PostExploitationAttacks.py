Shellter is not just an EPO infector that tries to find a location to insert an instruction to redirect execution to the payload. Unlike any other infector, Shellter’s advanced infection engine never transfers the execution flow to a code cave or to an added section in the infected PE file. Shellter uses a unique dynamic approach which is based on the execution flow of the target application. This means that no static/predefined locations are used for shellcode injection.
